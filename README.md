# my startpage

A demo of a little html/css/js start page i came up with. No external frameworks
(Bootstrap, etc); just a Google Font, some Javascript, and an HTML/CSS template.

Each of the modules (time, the greeting text, date, links...) can be modified to
your liking; I've tried to make their respective `.js` files accessible enough
for anyone to modify. I'd read the `status` section though. 

It's short on links so as not to doxx myself (as a few I would have wanted would
have done just that).

## status

I plan to make this code a little cleaner and a little more modular with time.
I want to add another section of links under the initial one, and support similar modules
being swapped in and out for customizability reasons. Right now this is hardcoded to
work how I intend to use it. CSS rules are based on how I'm viewing the page, and
accessability and responsiveness to window sizing weren't of particular concern,
so expect dragons. I plan on cleaning that up eventually, so if it happens, I'll update
this readme.
